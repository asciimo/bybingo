prompt

- The user will specify how many output TSV files to create. For example, 1, 9,
30, etc. If the user specifies 5, then 5 TSV files will be created.
- Each TSV file will have 5 columns and 6 rows. 
- The first row of each column will always be B, I, N, G, O
- For each remaining row, the script will pick a random value for each column
corresponding to the key in the source JSON file. For example, for the first
column in the row, "B", it will pick a random value from the "B" array in the JSON 
file. In the second column, "I",  it will pick a random value from the "I" array in
the JSON file, and so on.
- For each TSV file, no values will be duplicated. Each column should consist
of unique values from its array in the JSON file
- The 3rd column of the 4th row, "N",  will always have the value "FREE".
